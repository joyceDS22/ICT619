Led a health-focused AI initiative targeting diabetes risk in the high-risk Pima Indian community using Python. 
The project explored and compared three advanced machine learning approaches: 1) Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), 2) MLP combined with Logistic Regression (MLP+LR), and 3) MLP combined with Random Forest (MLP+RF). 
Models were evaluated using performance metrics including ROC-AUC, and further assessed for efficiency through scalability and inference speed. 
To enhance accessibility, a user-friendly interface was developed using Streamlit, supported by a .py script and requirements.txt, enabling seamless interaction with the AI-driven insights.
